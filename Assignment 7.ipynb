    "Abstraction is the process of representing the essential features or behaviors of an object while hiding the unnecessary details. It allows us to focus on what an object does rather than how it does it. Abstraction is achieved through abstract classes and interfaces, defining a contract or blueprint for derived classes to follow. It helps in creating generalized and reusable code, promoting code modularity and maintainability. Abstraction is about providing a high-level view or interface to the users of a class or module."

    "Encapsulation is the process of bundling data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on that data together within a class. It involves hiding the internal state of an object and providing controlled access to the object's attributes through methods. Encapsulation helps in achieving data abstraction and data hiding, ensuring that the object's state is accessed and modified only through defined interfaces. It provides security, prevents direct access to internal data, and allows for better control and validation of data. Encapsulation is about packaging related data and methods together, forming a cohesive unit."
